# General Thought Process
- My genreal thought process behind the storyboard was that the most essential goals for this app would be
  creating an account, some way to create an order, and what happens after the order is placed (receiving it). As I started
  to brainstorm, I realised that the main goals could be divided further into checking out and tracking your order. Once I decided,
  the main goals started thinking about how to accomplish these goals with the story, and later many tasks. For the MVP, I decided
  that the most important features were to make an account, have a basic way to select items, confirm your order, and finally be
  notified when the order has reached it's destination. The second release has more advanced features like item preferences and many
  more. I took a lot of inspiration from the uber eats app when creating this story board.

# Three Decisions Made For Storyboard
1. Have the items initailly displayed by category in the inital release. I decided to put this in the initial release because
I thought that it would be very tedious if there were just a huge display off all the stores items and would lead customers away.

2. Seperate the Epics receiving keeping track of order and receiving order. I decided to separate these because I thought that they may have many different features associated with them and I felt they don't quite fit into the same category

3. I decided to preset user info and locations in the second release because I didn't think it was fully necessary to have a working   application, although it may be tedious to enter an address or info every time you use the app.

# Extra Feature Used
- The extra task that I used was the personas in order to show who is responsible for specific tasks
